## 🔧 Technical Fixes & Updates

### NextAuth v5 Migration
- Updated all authentication calls from `getServerSession(authOptions)` to `auth()`
- Fixed imports in:
  - `app/api/bookings/checkout/route.ts`
  - `app/api/bookings/route.ts`
  - `app/bookings/[id]/success/page.tsx`
  - `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Reason: NextAuth v5 uses different API than v4

### Stripe SDK Updates
- Replaced `stripe.redirectToCheckout()` with direct URL redirect
- Reason: Newer Stripe.js versions use Checkout URLs instead of `redirectToCheckout`
- Fixed API version to latest stable: `2025-09-30.clover`

### Build-Time Safety
- Made Stripe initialization optional (no crash if env var missing during build)
- Added null checks in all Stripe API endpoints
- Graceful error messages if Stripe not configured
