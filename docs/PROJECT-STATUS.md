## 🚀 **Recommended Next Steps**

### **Parallel Development Strategy** (Maximize Velocity)

Since TRACK 2 is complete, you can now run TRACK 3 and TRACK 4 in parallel:

#### **Option A: Focus on TRACK 3 (Tours System)** 🎯 RECOMMENDED
**Why**: Tours are the core product - get them working end-to-end first
1. Complete tour detail page with image gallery
2. Implement advanced filtering and search
3. Add pagination/infinite scroll
4. Polish UX with loading states and animations
5. Test booking flow integration points

**Benefit**: Users can browse and explore tours immediately

---

#### **Option B: Start TRACK 4 (Authentication)** 🔐
**Why**: Required for bookings, enables user accounts
1. Install and configure NextAuth.js
2. Build working login/signup flow
3. Add protected routes middleware
4. Create user dashboard
5. Test session management

**Benefit**: Foundation for TRACK 5, enables personalization

---

#### **Option C: Parallel Execution** ⚡ FASTEST
**Why**: No dependencies between TRACK 3 and TRACK 4
- Work on TRACK 3 in this window
- Work on TRACK 4 in parallel (if you have multiple developers)
- Both can proceed independently until TRACK 5

**Benefit**: Fastest path to MVP completion (~5-7 days to MVP)

---

## 🔍 **Build Status**

✅ **Latest Build**: PASSING (2025-10-28)
- All 18 routes compile successfully
- TypeScript type-checking passes
- Static pages pre-render correctly
- Minor warnings (expected for dynamic routes)

---

## 🎯 **What Would You Like To Do Next?**

1. **Continue TRACK 3** - Complete Tours System (detail pages, filtering, search)
2. **Start TRACK 4** - Implement Authentication (NextAuth setup, login/signup)
3. **Parallel Execution** - Give me specific guidance on which track for this window
4. **Review/Refine** - Go back and polish existing pages
5. **Something Else** - Custom direction

Which direction would you like to take? I'm ready to dive into implementation! 🚀
