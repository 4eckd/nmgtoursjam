# Type can be
#    feat     (new feature)
#    fix      (bug fix)
#    refactor (refactoring production code)
#    style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    docs     (changes to documentation)
#    test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    chore    (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc)
#    security (security fixes or improvements)
#    perf     (performance improvements)
# --------------------
# Remember to:
#   - Capitalize the subject line
#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
# --------------------
# Common Patterns:
#
# feat(auth): add OAuth login support
# fix(api): handle null response from /users endpoint
# docs: update deployment guide with new env vars
# security: remove exposed API keys from config
# chore(deps): update Next.js to v16.0.3
# --------------------
# 💡 Before committing, ask yourself:
#   ✓ Does the build pass? (pnpm build)
#   ✓ Are there any security vulnerabilities? (npm audit)
#   ✓ Did I test my changes?
#   ✓ Is this one logical change or should it be split?
#   ✓ Did I remove debug statements?
